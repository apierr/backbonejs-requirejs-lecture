hands-on-backbone-require-js
============================

Course Description
This course, divided in three parts, deals with the development of MVC (Model-View-Controller) web applications, using the Backbone.js with its extension Backbone.Marionette and the Require.js library.

In the first part of the course, we examine the concepts of Backbone.js and the problems Backbone.js has been designed to solve. 
After introducing the basic notions of MVC web application, such as Models, Views, Collections, Events, Listener, Template and Rendering, we write our first Backbone.js application in order to put in practice the knowledge we acquired. 

However, Backbone.js is not a complete framework, because it leaves much of the application design, architecture and scalability to the developer, including memory management, view management and more. 
This is the reason why, in the second part of the course, we build a much more robust project with great separation of concerns between design and code, combining Backbone.js and its extension,  Backbone.Marionette.

In the third part of the course, we see in details how to use the library Require.js to write - in the javascript code - 
a program organised in modules, each of them in a single file,
with dependent variables which do not pollute the global scope.

Then, we see an alternate approach using routes to determine when modules are loaded and how to use Require.js to minifier and optimize your multi-file in javascript into one lean package, in order to use it in production.
